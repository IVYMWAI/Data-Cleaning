# Data-Cleaning
Data Cleaning is the process of handling missing values,removing and or changing wrong,incomplete and duplicated data in a dataset to ensure that the data is accurate for analysis.

This project shows a step by step data cleaning process.

As a data analyst,the most challenging part about working with data is to ensure that the data is accurate,well sorted and formatted as having wrong data can lead to inconsistency in the output leading to mediocre interpretation of the results and well,who wants that?

This whole project will incorporate the use of two python libraries:numpy and pandas to clean the data. Pandas converts the dataset into a dataframe ,ie,the combination of rows and columns like in an excel sheet.
