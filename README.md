# Data-Cleaning
Data Cleaning is the process of handling missing values,removing and or changing wrong,incomplete and duplicated data in a dataset to ensure that the data is accurate for analysis.

This project shows a step by step data cleaning process.

As a data analyst,the most challenging part about working with data is to ensure that the data is accurate,well sorted and formatted as having wrong data can lead to inconsistency in the output leading to mediocre interpretation of the results and well,who wants that?

This whole project will incorporate the use of several python libraries:
      1.Numpy for mathematical operations. 
      2.Pandas to read the data file,change the dataset into a dataframe for cleaning and exploring the data. 
      3.Matplotlib to visualize the dataset.

Steps followed to clean the data.
    1.Handling missing values:dropping the missing values and filling in the missig values.
    2.changing the data types-parsing dates
    3.Handling inconsistent data entry.
    4.Handling outliers.
